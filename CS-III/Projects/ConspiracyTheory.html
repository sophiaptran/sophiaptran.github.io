	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Social media has revolutionized the way we share our lives, allowing us to instantly broadcast our personal information on a worldwide scale with just a simple click. This vast reach allows countless individuals to swiftly access and disseminate our personal lives. Furthermore, because of its easy access and the dopamine it provides, Social media is highly addictive. Unfortunately, individuals are not solely addicted to social media. Rather, they are also addicted to search engines and video-sharing platforms that employ algorithms to captivate their audience and cultivate user addiction. Frequently using these platforms can make individuals vulnerable to misinformation and deceptive facts. </p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	 Many applications, including netflix, facebook, and instagram, have recommended algorithms. Recommend algorithms serve as a filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. The primary purpose is to provide users with engaging and relevant content based on their interests. To recommend posts and videos, the algorithm draws from previous likes, searches, shares, and engagement from the user. By analyzing users' patterns and typical online behaviors, these algorithms can anticipate the type of content that would captivate the individual. This personalized approach tailors to the user's experience, fostering a desire to continue using the platform regularly and making it more addictive.
	
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>The Feedback Loop</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
Feedback loops are an endless loop of instructions that can be given to a computer that has no final step. They gather data based on a user's frequency of engagement with a particular type of content. Through these interactions, the algorithm gains insights and subsequently suggests content within a similar category to the user. When a user frequently shows interest and interacts with specific content, the algorithm further populates the user's feed with content of a similar genre, resulting in a progressively homogeneous content experience. Conversely, if a user expresses disinterest or refrains from engaging with certain content, the algorithm takes this feedback into consideration and refrains from presenting that particular topic to the user. Feedback loops thus create a mechanism for users to continue using the platform as they consistently encounter content they enjoy and prefer.
	
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  As content algorithms become more precise in tailoring recommendations to users, they inadvertently promote extreme forms of content, such as conspiracy theories, that tend to captivate users. Recommendation algorithms aim to extend user engagement time, leading them to prioritize content that has a high potential to captivate viewers, including conspiracy theories. Consequently, these algorithms intensify the proliferation of conspiracy-related videos and vigorously push them towards viewers in a bid to maximize user interactions, often overlooking the potentially harmful nature of the content. </p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Platform Incentives</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  The primary driving force behind the widespread use of recommendation algorithms across various platforms is the pursuit of higher revenue. As these algorithms increasingly promote captivating and controversial content, the primary beneficiaries are the companies themselves and the creators of such content. Both parties reap the rewards of enhanced viewer engagement, resulting in increased revenue and popularity. Additionally, corporations generate income through targeted advertising facilitated by recommendation algorithms. By delivering advertisements tailored to individuals' unique interests, these platforms increase the likelihood of interaction or even purchases. Ultimately, the primary motivation for these platforms revolves around accumulating revenue. </p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Potential for Exploitation</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  While these algorithms offer substantial benefits, particularly for businesses and content producers, they can also be wielded with malicious intent to deceive consumers. Despite the existence of platform guidelines regulating creators' content, creators often circumvent these rules through tactics like using misleading thumbnails and enticing titles to drive engagement. In the context of conspiracy theories, algorithms can promote highly captivating content, including deceptive conspiracy videos, thereby amplifying the dissemination of conspiracy theories and other harmful content. Presently, it's alarmingly simple to manipulate and disseminate misinformation, with many individuals resorting to these tactics to enhance their platform's engagement, revenue, and profile growth. This vulnerability can be easily exploited, resulting in widespread misconceptions among the public. </p>
