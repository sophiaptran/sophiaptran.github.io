      These graphs portray the effectiveness of the three sorts: bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. Bubble sort works by comparing two elements at a time, switching them if the element on the right is less than the element on the left. Insertion sort works similarly, except it only looks at one element at a time. Lastly, selection sort works by finding the smallest element in the list and switching it to the front. I ran each sort through a variety of tests. I used each sort to alphabetically sort lists that were ordered, reverse ordered, and random. Furthermore, each type had lists of one word, ten words, one hundred words, one thousand words, ten thousand words, and one hundred thousand words. I ran each list five times through each sort, timing them to see which was the fastest. The results from these tests can be seen on the spreadsheet and the three graphs.

      In all sorts, all lists with one word and ten words were very similar, each being about five milliseconds. In addition to this, all three graphs were also similar in the fact that they all grew exponentially, taking more time with the more words sorted. With this being said, the fastest sort was bubble sort. When sorting one hundred thousand words, bubble sort took about one thousand milliseconds while insertion sort and selection sort took about three hundred thousand milliseconds. Overall, these graphs were able to display the time each sort took, with bubble sort taking the shortest amount of time.
