	<b> Introduction: </b> <br>
	Assigning each member a position is the best method to maintain organization and productivity when working on a project with a group or team. By having roles, everyone is able to contribute to the team and understand their particular responsibilities. The roles of (software) development engineer, QA engineer, project manager, product manager, and release engineer are a few that are commonly utilized. <br>
	<b> (Software) Development Engineer: </b> <br>
	Development engineers are in charge of determining a company's objectives while conceptualizing, designing, and testing a new product or product line. In my circumstance, this role is in charge of writing, testing, and debugging the code for our application. The presence of development engineers may be seen in practically every industry. Because of this, they undertake important positions and have big obligations. This is a great role, however I don't think that I am suitable for this role. I'd need to be far more knowledgeable about computer science and the development of applications. To overcome this, I could educate myself more about programming and the development process. <br>
	<b> QA Engineer: </b> <br>
	QA Engineers, also known as Quality Assurance Engineers, oversee the testing and quality management of software prior to the release. They are in charge of identifying and fixing bugs and errors to ensure that it runs properly and efficiently. QA Engineers have to be very detail oriented, and because of this, I feel like I would be a good fit for this role. Despite this, I anticipate that there will still be difficulties. For instance, I might encounter mistakes that I am unsure of how to correct. However, to overcome this, I will take advantage of my resources and research the bugs, or seek the aid of my peers or teacher. <br>
	<b> Project Manager: </b> <br>
	Project Managers plan and develop the project idea. Furthermore, they are in charge of deadlines and finances. Although money is not a major concern with our isp, deadlines are imperative. Project Managers lead and monitor the team, requiring good communication skills. They have to be creative, original, and punctual. Because of this, I think I would be a decent fit for this role. Although being a Project Manager entails a lot of responsibilities, I am well-organized and believe I can succeed with the support of my team. With that said, I might have some difficulty communicating with others and maintaining order, but this issue should be simple to resolve by simply being more assertive. <br>
	<b> Product Manager: </b> <br>
	Product Managers are responsible for planning and marketing. They have to be able to think in the customersâ€™ shoes and keep the customers best interest in mind. Being a customer myself, I think I could be decent with this role. However, this role also leads the group, which requires leadership skills. This poses the same problem as being a Project Manager, such as communicating with my team members. <br>
	<b> Release Engineer: </b> <br>
	Release Engineers are responsible for scheduling, planning, and monitoring the software's development and delivery process. They mainly concern themselves with the delivery of the software, instead of debugging code. I have good time management skills, which makes me a great candidate for this role. With this being said, I have a proclivity to procrastinate when I am faced with a large task. To overcome this, I will set deadlines for myself to keep myself accountable. <br>
