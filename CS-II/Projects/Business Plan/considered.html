With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because it is an ambitious proposal and unrealistic to finish by the deadline. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 2. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Team 2 </a> </b> <br> Especially in today's society, this idea would be helpful as it provides privacy and protects the user. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because the idea is unrealistic. Because many people have their cameras turned off or covered, it would be hard for the product to detect other’s eyes on the screen. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 3. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> The Unity Game </a> </b> <br> This idea seems fun. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because the idea is unclear and was not well described in their business proposal. Furthermore, I am personally not interested in developing a game currently. I would rather develop an app or website that could be beneficial to everyone. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 4. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/gautam-narayan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Low-Frequency Trading AI </a> </b> <br> This idea seems very thought-out and beneficial to its targeted audience. The business plan was thorough and well planned. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because I am not interested in stocks and would not want to spend a whole year researching and developing an application to predict stocks. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 5. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> DX3 </a> </b> <br> This seems like it would be very beneficial in today's society and could be used by many for a variety of purposes. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because this product seems a little bit too ambitious and expensive. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 6. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/juneyoung-hwang/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Team 6 </a> </b> <br> This idea seems very fun and practical. It was also well thought-out and feasible. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. Despite being interested in music myself, I am not interested in spending my time in creating an application like this. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 7. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> SchoolFood </a> </b> <br> This idea is practical and would be very helpful. Being a student who orders lunch everyday at school, this product would really be beneficial. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. Students are very lazy and most stand in line to talk to their friends. Because of this, I do not think that many students will end up using this application. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 8. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/reynard-gunawan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Smartshop </a> </b> <br> Being interested in fashion, I think this could be helpful. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because I don’t think it is really necessary. Most online stores already have filters to filter through their clothes on their website. Although there are not specific filters such as height and weight, there are still measurements listed for each clothing item. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 9. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/du-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Team 9 </a> </b> <br> This idea is very interesting and fascinating. With this being said, although this is a good plan, I have ultimately decided to reject it. This is because this is very ambitious. Although ISPs should be challenging and involve research, this idea seems too complicated and I do not think I will be able to contribute much to the team. </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgb(247, 242, 241); font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"> <b> 10. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Sheltersafe </a> </b> <br> After much consideration, I have decided that I would like to join this project. This project, Sheltersafe, is an application that offers information on how to take safety measures in the event of a natural disaster. Although this idea can be a bit challenging, I believe it would be very rewarding to help develop. Furthermore, I think with the entire group, it could be feasible in the time span provided, which is something that most plans failed to consider. I decided to accept this project because it’s main intention is to help people in need during devastating times. Its message is very important, and because of this, I would like to be a part of this project. </p>
