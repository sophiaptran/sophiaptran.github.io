	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Sentient AI will eventually lead to a utopia for all humans. Although the advancements may be slow, the process of improvement is accelerating. As a result, with this rate of improvement, AI will give us new tools to advance our society. For example, things like “[curing] diseases, [colonizing] space, and [adverting] ecological disaster” will all be made possible with AI. (Roose 2022). Because of this, AI will allow us to live longer and healthier lives. Furthermore, it will also provide us with new opportunities. The possibilities with AI are limitless. “‘A.I. systems can go from adorable and useless toys to very powerful products in a surprisingly short period of time” (Roose 2022).  It already has improved and achieved so much that the difference and progress is noticeable to everyone, even to those who aren’t a part of the research. “A.I. is getting better at lots of things these days” including areas where humans once had the upper hand (Roose 2022). For example, AI is improving in language and reasoning. It also can turn text descriptions into accurate hyper-realistic images. </p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Diffusion of Sentient AI</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  The use of sentient AI is starting to diffuse. It already is in a lot of everyday apps. For instance, A.I. in social media apps including Facebook, Youtube, and Tiktok. AI allows these pages to customize content that you will like and find entertaining. Furthermore, AI is also used in “weapons used by the military and software used by children in their classrooms” (Roose 2022). In addition to this, Banks use AI to determine those eligible for loans and police departments use AI to investigate crimes. AI is already used in so many aspects of our society, and it will only continue to be incorporated even more. In only a few years, photos, videos, and text we see on the internet could all be A.I. generated. </p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Science Fiction Versus Real Life</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Some people may argue that sentient AI is unreliable. In the industry, there are researchers who have trouble distinguishing reality and science. Because of this, researchers can mislead people by saying technology is capable of a lot of unrealistic abilities when it actually isn't. With this being said, struggling to differentiate science fiction and real life is actually very beneficial to the AI field. For example, this allows them to “dream of the full range of the possible” (Metz 2022). By believing something that may seem outrageous, it allows researchers to set goals and work to achieve what we think is impossible right now.</p>
