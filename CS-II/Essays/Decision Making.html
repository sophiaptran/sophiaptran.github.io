	<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:2;"><b>Decision Making</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Whether it's from other people or even their own biases, people are quite susceptible to influence. Every day, biases affect even routine judgments.A decision bias is defined as “deviations from rational decision making” (Arnott, 1998, p. 3). Although many people associate the word “bias” with a negative connotation, decision biases are actually “often positive manifestations” (Arnott, 1998, p. 4). With this being said, they cause poor decisions and result in a proclivity towards irrational choices.
	</p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Confirmation Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	Confirmation bias is when an individual seeks and interprets new information that confirms or supports their already existing beliefs. Because of this, information can be ignored if it “contradicts one's values” (Arnott, 1998, p. 8). Most physicians have confirmation bias, particularly if they are drained and pressed for time. The majority of the time, doctors would discharge patients who required more care after simply checking for what they believed to be wrong. Confirmation bias might have an impact on my group and I as we develop our isp. We might overlook information that will help us advance our ideas, if we retain a closed mind when receiving input on our project. To get over this, I'll have an open mind and watch out for confirmation bias when forming my thoughts.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Correlation Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  When an individual correlates or forms a relationship between two unrelated variables, it is known as correlation bias. This can lead to the formation of a false assumption, which has detrimental implications on one's choice. Typically, a correlation bias is “resistant to change,” which indicates how significant their impacts can be (Arnott, 1998, p. 10). For instance, stated by David Arnott in A Taxonomy of Decision Biases, if an individual visits a city on a day with miserable weather, they may make a correlation between the city and bad weather. With this being said, in reality, most days the city has great weather. Although this example is minor, correlation bias can be detrimental and incorrect. Correlation bias impacts my everyday life as I made a correlation between what I wear and what I will score on an exam. This bias formed a few years ago, as they “develop in a human … about 14 or 15 years of age” (Arnott, 1998, p. 10). Although there is no connection between the two, I am convinced that, based on past performance, I will score poorly on an exam if I wear new clothing. To overcome this, I will have to overlook this obstacle and ignore my intrusive thoughts to prove to myself that it is incorrect and just a correlation bias.

	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Desire Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Desire bias “has to do with wishful thinking … and greed” (Arnott, 1998, p. 10). For instance, someone might wish to be the lottery winner. However, because winning the lottery is unlikely to happen, desire bias distorts their judgment, making them unreasonable and greedy. This can affect my isp, because my group and I may be too ambitious with our goals and ideas for our end product. Desire bias “can seriously reduce decision quality” (Arnott, 1998, p. 10). To overcome this bias, we can be reasonable with our ideas and manage our time efficiently.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Inconsistency Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Inconsistency bias “include boredom, distraction, fatigue, and the general human desire for variety” (Arnott, 1998, p. 14). As a high school student, this bias has a significant impact on my life. I spend roughly eight hours a day, five days a week, in school, so my routine makes me yearn for variation and change. As a result, I don't always start my homework on time, which forces me to stay up late to complete it. To get over this, I'll change another aspect of my life, like what I eat, and start my homework as soon as possible to avoid late nights.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Overconfidence Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Having confidence and self assurance is common and a great quality to have. However, overconfidence is undesirable and can be obnoxious. Overconfidence, however, is unfavorable and can be irritating. Overconfidence is a form of bias that results from someone having an excessive degree of confidence in themselves or their opinions. Most experiments on this bias attempt to “measure the degree of a subject’s metaknowledge,” or in other words, knowledge about knowledge (Arnott, 1998, p. 16). This bias can have a negative impact on my group and I if we get overly confident about our isp and final result. Because of this bias, we could miss elements that can elevate our isp. To overcome this bias, we will be self aware and rational with our ideas.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Whether a person is aware of it or not, bias affects every decision they make in life. Biases “blind you from the truth,” resulting in unreasonable or incorrect decisions (Thriving in the face of contradiction). Individuals must keep the big picture in mind, and stay clear of biases that might negatively affect their decisions.
