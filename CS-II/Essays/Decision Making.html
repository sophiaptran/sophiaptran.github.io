	<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:2;"><b>Decision Making</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	Humans are very easily influenced, whether it's by other people or even their own biases. Even mundane decisions are influenced by biases everyday. A decision bias is defined as “deviations from rational decision making” (Arnott, 1998, p. 3). Although many people associate the word “bias” with a negative connotation, decision biases are actually often positive manifestations. With this being said, they cause poor decisions and result in a proclivity towards irrational choices.</p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Confirmation Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Confirmation bias is when an individual seeks and interprets new information that confirms or supports their already existing beliefs. Most physicians have confirmation bias, especially when they are tired and in a rush. Physicians would just check for what they believe is wrong, and most of the time discharge patients who need more care. Confirmation bias could affect me and my group in the process of creating our isp. If we keep a closed mind on feedback with our project, we will miss crucial details to advance our ideas. To overcome this, I will have an open mind set and make sure my ideas are not negatively affected by confirmation bias.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Correlation Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Correlation bias is when an individual makes a correlation or relationship between two variables when no relationship exists. Because of this, a false assumption is formed, resulting in negative effects to one's decision. Typically they are “resistant to change,” which means they can have significant impacts. For example, stated by Arnott, if an individual visits a city on a day with bad weather, they may make a correlation between the city with bad weather, when in reality, most days the city has great weather. Correlation bias impacts my everyday life as I make a correlation between what I wear and what I will score on an exam. Both of these factors have no correlation, however, I believe that if I wear a new outfit, I will score poorly on an exam based on previous experience. To overcome this, I will have to get over this obstacle and prove to myself that it is incorrect.
	</p>	
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Desire Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Desire bias “has to do with wishful thinking” (Arnott, 1998, p. 10). This can affect my isp because my group and I may be too ambitious with our goals and end product. To overcome this bias, we can have reasonable ideas and manage our time efficiently.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Inconsistency Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Inconsistency bias “include boredom, distraction, fatigue, and the general human desire for variety” (Arnott, 1998, p. 14). This bias heavily affects my life as a high school student. Because I go to school for almost eight hours every weekday, I like change and variety. As a result, I am inconsistent in starting my homework, which leads to staying up late to complete it. To overcome this, I will find another factor in my life to vary and start my homework as soon as possible to avoid late nights.	  
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2;"><b>Overconfidence Bias</b></p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:50px; line-height:2;">
	  Overconfidence bias is when an individual is overly confident. This bias can impact my group and I as we could be overly confident about our isp. Because of this bias, we could miss elements that can elevate our isp.
