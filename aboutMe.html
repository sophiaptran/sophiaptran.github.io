    <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:20px; text-indent:50px">
      Hello, my name is Sophia Tran. I am 16 years old and I am a junior at Allen High School. Some extracurricular activities that I am involved in include playing the violin in orchestra and computer science. I enjoy these activities as they allow me to explore my creativity and imagination. Furthermore, some hobbies that I enjoy are scrolling through tiktok, painting, and spending time with friends. As a student, I am currently pursuing a career in computer science. I have always been interested in this field and find it to be very rewarding. My goal is to develop a game that can be enjoyed by many. I look forward to taking my skills and expanding my knowledge to accomplish these goals.

      My digital portfolio is important to me because it is a place where I can showcase myself and my accomplishments. Furthermore, it helps me stay organized as it contains everything in one place. It is clean, neat, and avaliable for anyone to view. In addition to this, my digital portfolio will be with me for the rest of my life, and it will benefit me in the future. For example, my digital portfolio will allow me to demonstrate and display my growth to my future colleagues and employers.

    <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:20px; text-indent:50px">
      This is my second year in a computer schience course. Last year I took computer science one. I really enjoyed this class as it taught me a lot and I made many memorable memories. Some things I learned in this class were boolean algebra and logic gates. I also learned about scope and arrays. In addition to this, we also learned about computer architecture and it's history. Ultimately, I learned useful knowedge in analysing, designing, and debugging code. </p>
